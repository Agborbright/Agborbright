### Fraud Analyst 
Imagine managing a bank, insurance company, or fintech and your customer have been reporting numerous fradulent activities on their account to your team; they block the debit card or credit card but the team can tell which means does the fraudsters uses the most. This is were you need a fraud analyst.

As a fraud analyst, I build a reports and dashboards that shows the management team which means fraudsters uses to take funds from victims accounts and how they can prevent it from ocurring next time.
